# 5. Lambda handlers will communicate with the DB Cache and share a separated VPC

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Each API request requires some data from the Data Cache and to perform some processing of this data per request.

## Decision

We decided to use lamda functions to process each separate request in order.

## Consequence

This will allow to incrementally add new endpoints while being able to update and test each path independently.
